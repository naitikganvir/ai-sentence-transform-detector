[ðŸ“‘ Sentence Transformation Classification

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
The task is to build a AI ML model that can
detect sentence transformation types such as:

1)Active â†’ Passive
2)Passive â†’ Active
3)Direct â†’ Indirect Speech
4)Indirect â†’ Direct Speech
5)Positive â†’ Negative
6)Negative â†’ Positive

This model should classify the transformation applied between 
an original sentence and its transformed sentence.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Description
Manually created dataset of sentence pairs.

Each record contains:

Original Sentence

Transformed Sentence

Label (type of transformation)

ðŸ“Œ Example:

ID	Original Sentence	Transformed Sentence	Label
1	The company will launch the new product next quarter	The new product will be launched by the company next quarter
Active â†’ Passive


ðŸ”¹ Model Details
Model Type: Transformer-based classifier (BERT).
Task: Multi-class classification (6 transformation types).

Frameworks:
PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn, Streamlit, Matplotlib

HuggingFace Transformers (BERT) 

Shap for XAI

Scikit-learn

ðŸ”¹ Training & Evaluation

Metrics used:

Accuracy Score

Evaluation performed using confusion matrix analysis.


ðŸ”¹ Explainability

Used SHAP to explain predictions.
Highlights words that influenced classification.

Example:
Input: "The teacher said, 'You must study hard.'"

Prediction: Direct â†’ Indirect Speech

SHAP shows influence of 'said' and quotation marks.

ðŸ”¹ Error Analysis
Observed confusions between:
structural changes look similar, So the model get Confused sometime

ðŸ”¹ Deployment 

Lightweight app built using Streamlit.

Features:

Upload sentence pairs
Predict transformation type
Explain predictions with SHAP

Run with:

streamlit run src/app_streamlit.py]()
